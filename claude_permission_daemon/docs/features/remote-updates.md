# Remote Updates

You must read, understand, and follow all instructions in `./README.md` when planning and implementing this feature.

## Overview

This application is working great, but it doesn't currently detect if a claude permission request is approved not via slack when swayidle reports that the session is still idle, such as if claude is running via `tmux` and I connect to the session remotely over SSH and approve it. Please evaluate the possible solutions to this problem, present them to me for decision, and then implement the one(s) I pick including relevant documentation and test updates.
